    <h3>Welcome to the Stock Market!</h3>
    <p>This app was created to explain some of the basics of the stock market and to make it a little less scary to beginners. Here, we will explain just a few of the concepts you will find in our little game. </p>
    <h4>Risk </h4>
    <p>Investing in anything carries a risk. The value of said item could fall or the investment could be lost. Never invest money that you need! This page will hopefully help you understand how risk is evaluated and managed in the stock market.  </p>
    <h4>Market Capitalization</h4>
    <p>Also known as market cap, this term simply refers to the overall value of a company's stocks. Once can find this value by simply multiplying a company's stock price with the total of their outstanding stocks. </p>
    <h4>Stock Caps</h4>
    <p>Experts measue the overall market capitalization of a business and label public business as large, medium, or small cap stocks.</p>
    <h5>Large-cap</h5>
    <p>Large cap stocks tend to be steady streams of income over time because they are tried and true businesses that make substantial revenues year after year.
       Stocks of these kinds tend to follow the general trend of the market and are not as likely to make major gains or losses. </p>
       <h5> Mid-cap</h5>
       <p> Mid-cap stocks is a term used to define stocks that do meet the market cap necessary to be marked as large cap stock. These stocks tend to be steady earners but also have the potential to grow substantially over time.
         Buyers tend to enjoy mid-cap stock's balance between growth and stability.  </p>
         <h5> Small-cap</h5>
         <p>Small-cap stocks represent companies that have not had the chance to fully bloom into a major corporation. Buyers tend to take on a great deal of risk by investing in small-cap stocks; however, the growth potential in these companies
           is often what compels buyers to purchase them.
         </p>
         <h5>Spectulative</h5>
         <p>Speculative investments are often not stocks at all. These items tend to fluctuate quite wildly and are often not necessarily wise decisions to make when it comes to your money. In the words of Burton Malkiel, invest in items like gold if don't mind some bouts of insomnia. Any speculative crazy such as this 
           make require you to find even greaters fools to purchase your investments. </p>
            <h4> Stock Betas</h4>
            <p>Beta is simply a measure of stock volatility. Positive betas imply a stock has a positive correlation with the market: if one rises the other tends to rise with it. Most stocks are postive betas and we simply measure how much they move alongside the markets. The higher the beta, the higher the risk and also the higher the possible reward.
              Negative beta stocks also exists. These are stocks that go agains the market and will generally rise when the market falls. If you believe a market crash is soon to follow, diversifying your portfolio with negative beta stocks could be a possible move to offset your overall risk.  </p>
           <h3> How do you play the Stock Market?</h3>
           <p> There are an incredibly amount of strategies to take as an approach. If you want to try and predict the market by making very informed decision by analyzing news and public financial statements, go for it! 
             If you don't have the time to do all that research, then it is often advised to simply buy the market. This can be done by making a correct proportion of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks that rise and fall with the market.
             One general trend that you can generally bet on is that the markets tend to rise through history. If you rise and fall with it, you are not likely to make much money in the short-run; however, in the long-run you can gain
